Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The 100 and 1000 simulations proved to take less time than 10 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 10k times, the results are stable enough
